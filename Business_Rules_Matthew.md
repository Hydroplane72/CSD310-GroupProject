    A["Stan and Davis"] --> B["Janet Collins<br>Finances and Payroll"] & n2["Roz Murphy<br>Marketing"] & n4["Henry Doyle<br>Production Line"] & n6["Maria Costanza<br>Distribution"]
    n2 --> n3["Bob Ulrich<br>Assistant"]
    n4 --> n5["20 Employees"]
```
## Wish List
Stan and Davis
- Efficiently keep track of Inventory
- Efficiently order supplies
    - Perhaps over the internet

Maria
- Distributors to order online
- Track Shipments

## Information Needed
- Are Suppliers delivering on time?
    - Is there a large gap between expected delivery and actual delivery?
- Are all wines selling as they thought?
    - Is one wine note selling?
    - Which distributor carries which wine?
- How many hours did each employee work?
