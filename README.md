# Bacchus Group work requirements for CSD-310 Group Project

## Project Milestones
The intent of this project is to develop a pilot program that implements a solution to a case study. You will be working in groups for this project. Each group will work together to accomplish all aspects of the project. How you divide up the work is up to you. The group, as a whole, needs to come to an agreement on each element of the deliverables.
The deliverables for each milestone should be uploaded to your group discussion forum, and pushed to each team member’s GitHub account.

### Milestone #1
Find your group area and introduce yourself. Include when and how you will be available during the week. Read through the case studies and, as a group, select one for your final project. Create a list of business rules for your case study, including any assumptions you make.  Using those business rules, create an initial ERD to satisfy those rules.  The deliverable this week is a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, which case study was selected, business rules, and an initial ERD.

### Milestone #2
At this point, you should have an initial ERD and a set of business rules. Take another look at the ERD, add as many details as needed, including attributes for each table, make any revisions as needed. Once you have your tables in finalized state, write the Python script to create the tables in MySQL, and populate each with at least 6 records (fewer if noted in the case study, for example only three suppliers noted at Bacchus Winery). Write a python script that displays the data in each table, and take a screenshot of the results of the script that displays the data in each table. The deliverables this week are: The deliverables this week are: The Python script(s) and a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, revised ERD, and screenshot(s) of the data displayed from your tables.

### Milestone #3
Read through the case study again, and determine what information, retrieved from the tables (basically a report), will be helpful in making the business decisions listed in the case study. There should be a minimum of three reports.  Provide a description of the report, write the Python script to create the report, and take a screenshot of each report (result of query). The deliverables this week are: The Python script(s) and a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, description of the reports, and screenshot(s) of the results of running the queries.

### Milestone #4
Prepare a presentation of your case study solution. Include a group introduction, a brief description of the case study, the group ERD, a description of the reports you decided to generate, an example of each report result, and any assumptions you made about the case study that informed your design decisions.  Post the presentation to the Project Forum, and respond to at least three other submissions with either comments, suggestions, or corrections.

### Milestone #5
Make any revisions needed to finalize your presentation, then upload the final presentation to your GitHub account.

## Module 9
### Milestone 1
**Module 9 - **

*November 24 - November 30*

Find your group area and introduce yourself. Include when and how you will be available during the week.If your group would like to use an outside channel (Discord, Slack, Teams, etc.) to communicate throughout the project, that's fine. You do need to make sure that I am invited, as your participation in the group is graded. If there is no evidence that you contributed to the deliverables each week, you will not receive points for the deliverables. Read through the case studies and, as a group, select one for your final project. Create a list of business rules for your case study, including any assumptions you make. Using those business rules, create an initial ERD to satisfy those rules. The deliverable for this Milestone is a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, which case study was selected, a list of the business rules, and an initial ERD.

**Deliverable**
1) Create a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, which case study was selected, business rules, and an initial ERD.
2) Have one member of the group post the deliverable to your group forum in Blackboard, with a subject line of Milesone 1. Each team member should then push the deliverable to their GitHub account. No upload of files to Blackboard is necessary.

## Module 10
### Milestone 2

*December 1 - December 7*

At this point, you should have an initial ERD and a set of business rules. Take another look at the ERD, add as many details as needed, including attributes for each table, make any revisions as needed. Make sure all tables are in 3NF. Once you have your tables in finalized state, write the .sql script to create the tables in MySQL, and populate each with at least 6 records (fewer if noted in the case study, for example only three suppliers noted at Bacchus Winery). Write a python script that displays the data in each table (remember the movies example?), and take a screenshot of the results of the script that displays the data in each table. The deliverables for this Milestone are: The Python script(s)and a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, revised ERD, and screenshot(s) of the data displayed from your tables.

**Deliverable**
1) Zip up the Python script(s), a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, the revised ERD, and screenshot(s) of the data displayed from your tables.
2) Have one member of the group post the deliverable to your group forum, with a subject line of Milesone 2. Each team member should then push the deliverable to their GitHub account. No upload of files to Blackboard is necessary.

## Module 11
### Milestone 3

*December 8 - December 14*

Read through the case study again, and determine what information, retrieved from the tables (basically a report), will be helpful in making the business decisions listed in the case study. There should be a minimum of three reports.  Provide a description of the report, write the Python script to create the report, and take a screenshot of each report (result of query). The deliverables for this Milestone are: The Python script(s) and a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, description of the reports, and screenshot(s) of the results of running the queries.

### Milestone 4

*December 8 - December 14*

Prepare a presentation of your case study solution. Include a group introduction, a brief description of the case study, the finalized ERD, a description of the reports you decided to generate, an example of each report result, and any assumptions you made about the case study that informed your design decisions. Have one member of the group post the presentation to the Project Forum (located under Discussion Board menu item on the left..) for the class to review. Next week, each student will provide a critique of the presentations.

**Deliverable**
- The deliverables for this milestone should be posted to the Project Forum for the class.

## Module 12
### Milestone 5

*December 15 - December 21*

Read through the comments, suggestions, and corrections received from the class, and finalize your presentations. This is also the last time you can make revisions to your project. In a separate document, list any modification(s) made.

**Deliverable**
1) Revised case study presentation.
2) Revised case study code, if needed. If revised, please zip two revisions into one zip file.
3) In a separate document, list any modification(s) made.
